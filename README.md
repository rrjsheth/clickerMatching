# clickerMatching
Clicker matching is code specifically developed to find matches for iClicker questions asked in class
from current classes/previous quarters.

The goal of the project is to remove the chore of matching picture physically.

Using imageHashing techniques and OCR, potential matches are generated.


How to use:

python driver.py -i path/to/folder/ -t "n" -p thresh
